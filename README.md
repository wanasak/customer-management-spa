# Customer Management SPA

I did not created this project from the scratch actually I have cracked the code from the original source [here](https://github.com/DanWahlin/CustomerManager). It required the [backend part](https://github.com/wanasak/customer-management-api) for running.

### How to run
1) npm install
2) set a base service url in config.service.ts
3) npm serve

### Login Information
- Email = "admin@admin.com"
- Password = "admin123"
